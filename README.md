# haskell-examples

This repository contains small Haskell programs to bridge the gap between
the theory of Haskell and writing actual programs.

This repository contains multiple subdirectories, each of which is a separate
Haskell project. See the `README.md` file in the corresponding directory for
an explanation of the project in that directory. The Haskell source files will
also contain comments to explain concepts in-line.

## Set up

Install [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/),
which is the Haskell tool stack we use to run Haskell scripts, build Haskell
projects, and manage Haskell dependencies.
